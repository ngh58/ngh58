- 👋 Hi, I’m Nate
- 👀 I’m interested in coding as a hobby and to make it easier to understand the world around me.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, and how to use it for AI/ML data analysis
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on interesting projects that solve for challenging problems
- I'm especially interested in writing code to analyize datasets and determine which variables have the most impact on the outcome as a way to predict future results.
